# KnightHacksPubSub
We had all just met a few hours prior and were thinkning of ideas to the **ShellHacks Hackathon**, and one of our team members thinks of an ingenious idea, a way to track when Publix Sandwiches go on sale. As we were thinkning some more, a KnightHacks lead member came to us telling how someone created and made a Pub Sub api and website and discord bot, literally everything we were going for and more. However we decided to continue on with the project anyways in an attempt to create a fraction of what he could, while using his API.. So we must give much credit to him and their incredible work.

So now we present the same thing, but with a way to send notifications through your SMS device as Twilio is one of the ShellHacks sponsers.
